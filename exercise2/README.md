# Exercise 2

A simplified clone of the UNIX `find` command supporting the following syntax:

```
find <directory name> [-name <pattern>] [-type <f | d>] [-follow] [-xdev]
```

The `name` option accepts wildcards.

# Installation

Execute `make` and run `./bin/find --help` for a hint on how to use the
compiled program.
